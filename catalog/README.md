# Catalog metadata template

If your Nerdpack is ultimately headed for deployment in the [New Relic One Catalog](https://newrelic.github.io/nr1-catalog), you'll need to provide information for each of the following files in this directory.

If not, you can delete this `catalog` directory entirely.

## Requirements

Requirements for a [New Relic One Catalog Project](https://github.com/newrelic/open-source-office/blob/master/examples/categories/index.md#category-new-relic-one-catalog-project) are more complete than a Experimental repository, including:

- Meeting the requirements of a New Relic [Community Project](https://github.com/newrelic/open-source-office/blob/master/examples/categories/index.md#category-community-project), including having a designated maintainer(s)
- Having an empty state of the application workflow that guides users through the setup of configuration data that is stored in NerdStorage
- Undergoing the review process outlined in the [nr1-catalog website](https://newrelic.github.io/nr1-catalog)
- Maintaining a public roadmap (*recommended via a GitHub project in the repo*).
